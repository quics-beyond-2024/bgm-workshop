Registration is ongoing and will close on October 1st, 2024. 

Please register [<a href="https://forms.gle/N6t5TcLKWz5BJxEu7">here</a>] and await confirmation before making any travel arrangements. There is NO registration fee; however, registration and confirmation are required to attend the workshop due to limited capacity.

Please also fill in the poster information if you are interested in presenting a poster at the workshop. 

We also offer a limited number of travel funds for junior researchers (e.g., students and postdoctoral researchers). If you wish to apply for this funding, please indicate your interest in your registration. Selected applicants will receive reimbursement after the workshop.
