title: Reconfiguring Analog Rydberg Atom Quantum Computers for Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks

bio: Tirthak Patel is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rice University and the Director of Positive Technology Lab, conducting systems-level research at the intersection of quantum computing and high-performance computing (HPC). His research explores the trade-offs among factors affecting reliability, performance, and energy efficiency, in recognition of which he has received the ACM-IEEE CS George Michael Memorial HPC Fellowship and the NSERC Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship (CGS D-3). His work has also been nominated for the best paper award at several highly selective conferences, including Supercomputing (SC) and ICCAD. The tools, datasets, and methodologies from his work are largely open-sourced, as an important facet of his work is to make scientific research accessible. Prior to joining Rice University, he received his Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Northeastern University.

abstract: The digital quantum computing model has been leveraged for several machine learning tasks, including generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs). While quantum computers have been implemented with different types of technologies, recently, analog Rydberg atom quantum computers have been demonstrated to have desirable properties such as reconfigurable qubit positions and multi-qubit operations. To leverage the properties of this technology, this talk will describe the implementation of quantum GANs on analog Rydberg atom quantum computers with parameterized pulses and qubit positions. The evaluation of this implementation using simulations and the QuEra Aquila analog quantum computer shows 33% better quality — measured using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) — in generated images than the comparative technique implemented on digital superconducting-qubit technology.
