title: Silicon-based quantum processors

abstract: "Of all of the qubit modalities being pursued, semiconductor spin qubits most closely resemble
conventional transistors, which can be fabricated at scale with ~100 billion transistors on a chip. It is
therefore prudent to pursue long-term approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computing with
semiconductor spin qubits. I will give an update on recent progress, including high-fidelity multi-qubit
control [1,2], long-range spin-spin coupling [3,4], and two-dimensional spin qubit arrays [5,6].
