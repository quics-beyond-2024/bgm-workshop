bio: Tom Manovitz is an HQI fellow at Harvard. An experimental physicist, his work focuses on harnessing highly controlled quantum systems based on individual ultracold atoms to explore quantum computing, quantum many-body physics, and quantum precision metrology. His contributions to these fields include the realization of quantum computers, the development of high-fidelity quantum gates, the exploration of quantum phase transitions and non-equilibrium many-body dynamics, the study of topological states of matter, and the use of entangled states for precision measurement of atomic properties.

title: Quantum coarsening and collective dynamics on a programmable quantum simulator

abstract: Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter, fundamental high-energy processes, quantum metrology, and quantum algorithms. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.
