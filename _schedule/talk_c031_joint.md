bio: Vahagn Mkhitaryan is a Senior Research Associate at Purdue University. He earned his Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Yerevan State University in Armenia (2006-2010), followed by a Master’s degree in Plasmonics and Photonics (2010-2012) from the same institution. He pursued his PhD at ICFO – the Institute of Photonic Sciences in Barcelona, Spain, under the supervision of Professors Valerio Pruneri and Javier García de Abajo. His doctoral research involved the study of periodic nanophotonic structures and devices based on multilayer thin films of phase-change materials, where he combined both experimental techniques and theoretical modeling to investigate light-matter interactions in these systems. After completing his PhD, he continued at ICFO as a Postdoctoral Researcher (2017-2021) in the Nanophotonics Theory group, working with Prof. Javier García de Abajo. During this period, his research focused on electron energy loss spectroscopy and plasmons in atomically thin metals. In 2021, he moved to the United States and joined Purdue University, where he works with Prof. Vladimir Shalaev’s group. In his current role, he contribute to research on light-matter interaction, condensed matter physics, and quantum materials, with a focus on topological quantum systems and quantum simulations using Rydberg atom array-based simulators.
