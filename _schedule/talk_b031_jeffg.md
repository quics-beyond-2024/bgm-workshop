bio:  Jeff Grover is a Research Scientist in the EQuS group. He focuses on software infrastructure and building extensible calibration, control, and metrology protocols for multi-qubit systems. Prior to joining EQuS, he spent 5 years in industry â€“ 3 years as a Senior Physicist at Northrop Grumman working on quantum annealing in collaboration with MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and 2 years as a Senior Data Scientist at athenahealth applying machine learning to healthcare. He also had an earlier stint in EQuS in 2015 as a Postdoctoral Associate, where he used JTWPAs to generate broadband quantum-correlated radiation towards improving qubit readout. Jeff received his PhD in Physics from the Joint Quantum Institute at the University of Maryland in 2015. He graduated from Amherst College in 2009, majoring in Physics and Mathematics.

title: Emulating the Bose-Hubbard Model with Arrays of Superconducting Qubits

abstract: "Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits can be used as analog quantum simulators of tight-binding models with broadly adjustable model parameters. Here, microwave excitations in the array behave as strongly interacting particles according to the Bose-Hubbard model. In this talk, I will give an overview of superconducting qubit-based simulators with a focus on emulating two-dimensional materials. I will then describe recent experiments using a 4-by-4 square array of coupled transmon qubits: measuring the entanglement entropy of many-body states prepared at various energies, generating synthetic magnetic fields to observe key signatures like the Aharonov-Bohm effect, and studying flat-band (de)localization in a rhombic lattice. Time permitting, we will also discuss future directions such as increasing connectivity and scaling to larger arrays."
