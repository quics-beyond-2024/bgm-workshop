title: Analog quantum simulation with trapped ions

abstract: We will describe several projects focused on analog quantum simulation using trapped-ion chains. First, we will discuss a demonstration of universal scaling in a non-equilibrium setting [arXiv:2309.10856]. Second, we will discuss an observation of an equilibrium phase transition in 1D [arXiv:2310.19869]. Third, we will present a proposal for simulating meson scattering [arXiv:2403.07061]. Fourth, we will present theoretical and experimental results on string breaking.
