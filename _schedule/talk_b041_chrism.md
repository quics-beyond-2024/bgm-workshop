title: Gate and Analog Quantum Processing with Trapped Ions (theyâ€™re the same thing)

abstract: Trapped atomic ion qubits are the most mature of qubit platforms, with essentially infinite idle coherence time and near-perfect SPAM. The entanglement of trapped ion qubits via discrete gates or more global analog operations proceeds from the same physics, and there is hence a continuous transition between these two models of quantum processing. While the central challenge ahead is the engineering of trapped ion system to scale following some well-defined architectural paths, it will be critical to continue co-designing circuits, algorithms, and simulations to the systems as they grow. This is particularly important as the ion trap architecture enjoys the prospect of a reconfigurable and fully-connected qubit graph at scale.

bio: Christopher Monroe is the Gilhuly Family Presidential Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Physics at Duke University. He is also the Co-Founder and former CEO and Chief Scientist of IonQ, Inc., the first public pure-play quantum computing company. Monroe has pioneered nearly all aspects of trapped ion quantum computers and simulators, from demonstrations of the first quantum gate, monolithic semiconductor-chip ion trap, and photonic interconnects between physically separated qubits; to the design, fabrication, and use of full-stack ion trap quantum computer systems in both university and industrial settings. He is a key architect of the US National Quantum Initiative, a Fellow of the American Physical Society, Optical Society of America, the UK Institute of Physics, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and is a member of the National Academy of Sciences.
