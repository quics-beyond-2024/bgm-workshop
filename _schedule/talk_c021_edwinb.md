title: Control-based variational quantum algorithms and dynamical noise suppression

abstract: The simulation of strongly correlated systems is one of the most exciting potential applications of quantum computers. There is hope that variational algorithms could enable the simulation of classically intractable problems on near-term devices, but this requires significant reductions in both variational circuit depths and measurement counts. I will discuss our recent efforts to lower these resource demands by eliminating quantum gates and circuits completely and instead optimizing control pulses directly. I will also describe a general approach to designing control pulses that suppress noise while implementing qubit rotations that is based on shaping geometric space curves.

bio: Ed Barnes is a Professor of Physics and Moore Faculty Fellow at Virginia Tech, where he has been since 2015. Prior to that, he held a postdoctoral position at the University of Virginia and a senior research associate position in both the Joint Quantum Institute and the Condensed Matter Theory Center at the University of Maryland. He earned a doctoral degree in Physics from the University of California, San Diego in 2006.
