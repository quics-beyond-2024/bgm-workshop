title: Challenges and Successes in Solving Applications with Quantum Computers

abstract: In this talk I will give an overview of some recent efforts at Los Alamos National Laboratory to use quantum computers for solving important applications that require quantum physics simulation. Our findings indicate significant resource requirements for gate-based models of quantum computing, which increases the appeal of alternative models of computation, such as analog quantum computing. Examples of how analog quantum computers are already demonstrating interesting results will be presented.

bio: Dr. Carleton Coffrin is a senior scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory with expertise in computer science, optimization, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. Dr. Coffrin started exploring the field of quantum computation in 2016 and has had the opportunity to benchmark multiple generations of quantum computing hardware from vendors including D-Wave Systems and IBM. Dr. Coffrin was one of the founders of LANL's Quantum Computing Summer School program serving as a co-lead for three years (2018, 2019, 2020). Presently Dr. Coffrin leads a significant effort to understand and document how Los Alamos National Laboratory could use quantum computing technology to improve scientific discovery.
