title: Some Results on Aquila - QuEra’s neutral-atom analog quantum computer

abstract: I’ll introduce QuEra’s first-generation, 256-qubit analog quantum computer, Aquila, and present some recent scientific works using Aquila for demonstrations in the areas of quantum optimization, analog quantum simulation, and quantum machine learning. This includes an overview of the near-term applications that can be run on neutral-atom analog quantum computer, with hardware-native programmability and implementations.

bio: Dr. Shengtao Wang is currently the Head of Quantum Algorithms & Applications at QuEra Computing Inc., which is a leader in commercializing quantum computers using neutral atoms. Dr. Wang is an expert in the development of near-term quantum algorithms and applications, in the areas of quantum optimization, quantum simulation, and quantum machine learning. Prior to his position at QuEra, Dr. Wang was a postdoctoral scholar at the department of Physics at Harvard University, during which he developed near-term quantum optimization algorithms implementable on today’s neutral-atom quantum computers. He received his PhD in Physics at the University of Michigan – Ann Abor in 2017.
