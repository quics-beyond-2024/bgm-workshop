title: Thermalization and Criticality on an Analog-Digital Quantum Simulator

bio: Trond I. Andersen is a research scientist at Google Quantum AI, where he works on realizing new physical phenomena and beyond-classical applications on NISQ hardware. Trond received his B.S. in Physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied optoelectronic phenomena in graphene with Prof. Pablo Jarillo-Herrero. He then moved to Mikhail Lukin's group at Harvard University for his PhD, where he studied excitons in twisted 2D semiconductors, and also used nanoscale defects in diamond to probe electron-phonon dynamics in graphene. In his current work at Google, Trond is particularly focused on hybrid analog-digital quantum simulation, with the goal of using quantum hardware to gain new insights about both non-equilibrium phenomena and ground state properties in quantum magnets.

abstract: Understanding how interacting particles approach thermal equilibrium is a major challenge of quantum simulators. Unlocking the full potential of such systems toward this goal requires flexible initial state preparation, precise time evolution, and extensive probes for final state characterization. We present a quantum simulator comprising 69 superconducting qubits which supports both universal quantum gates and high-fidelity analog evolution, with performance beyond the reach of classical simulation in cross-entropy benchmarking experiments. Emulating a two-dimensional (2D) XY quantum magnet, we leverage a wide range of measurement techniques to study quantum states after ramps from an antiferromagnetic initial state. We observe signatures of the classical Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition, as well as strong deviations from Kibble-Zurek scaling predictions attributed to the interplay between quantum and classical coarsening of the correlated domains. This interpretation is corroborated by injecting variable energy density into the initial state, which enables studying the effects of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in targeted parts of the eigenspectrum. Finally, we digitally prepare the system in pairwise-entangled dimer states and image the transport of energy and vorticity during thermalization. These results establish the efficacy of superconducting analog-digital quantum processors for preparing states across many-body spectra and unveiling their thermalization dynamics.
