title: Characterizing the Noise in Quantinuumâ€™s Quantum Computers

abstract: Quantinuum has constructed two generations of gate-based digital quantum computers, building a sophisticated error model. In this talk I will go over our methods for quantum characterization, validation, and verification (QCVV), giving a suite of measurements for individual operations, holistic metrics, and applications. These measurements have direct implications on near-term applications, pointing toward where upgrade efforts should be concentrated. More recently, we have begun QCVV efforts on the logical level, and I will briefly mention some preliminary results.

bio: David Hayes is the Sr. Manager for Theory and Architecture on the hardware team, living in Broomfield, Colorado. There he focuses on designing next generation trapped-ion hardware, quantum error correction protocols, and near-term applications.
