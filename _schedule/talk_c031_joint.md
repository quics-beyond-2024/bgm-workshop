bio: Vahagn Mkhitaryan is a Senior Research Associate at Purdue University. He earned his Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Yerevan State University in Armenia (2006-2010), followed by a Master’s degree in Plasmonics and Photonics (2010-2012) from the same institution. He pursued his PhD at ICFO – the Institute of Photonic Sciences in Barcelona, Spain, under the supervision of Professors Valerio Pruneri and Javier García de Abajo. His doctoral research involved the study of periodic nanophotonic structures and devices based on multilayer thin films of phase-change materials, where he combined both experimental techniques and theoretical modeling to investigate light-matter interactions in these systems. After completing his PhD, he continued at ICFO as a Postdoctoral Researcher (2017-2021) in the Nanophotonics Theory group, working with Prof. Javier García de Abajo. During this period, his research focused on electron energy loss spectroscopy and plasmons in atomically thin metals. In 2021, he moved to the United States and joined Purdue University, where he works with Prof. Vladimir Shalaev’s group. In his current role, he contribute to research on light-matter interaction, condensed matter physics, and quantum materials, with a focus on topological quantum systems and quantum simulations using Rydberg atom array-based simulators.

bio2: Peter Komar is a Sr. Applied Scientist in the Amazon Braket team where he works on integration of new quantum devices to the Braket service and researches their applications. He holds a PhD in physics from Harvard University where he conducted theoretical research in the field of quantum metrology, searching for practical ways to achieve ultimate measurement accuracy, set by the Heisenberg limit. Peter is passionate about all means of extracting maximal information from limited data.

title: Quantum phases of Rydberg atoms on Shastry - Sutherland lattice

abstract: We explore the phase diagram of Rydberg atoms in a frustrated Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Using the density matrix renormalization group, we map out a rich phase diagram in a three-dimensional parameter space that is naturally realizable in current Rydberg atom platforms. In particular, besides a plethora of classical phases, we show the presence of phases stabilized exclusively by quantum fluctuations. We employ order parameter symmetry analysis to show the presence of novel quantum critical points. Lastly, we tested most of the theoretical predictions experimentally using QuEra’s Rydberg quantum computer on Amazon Braket and found excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experiments.
