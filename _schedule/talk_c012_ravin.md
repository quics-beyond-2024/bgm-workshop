title: Realizing multi-qubit entangling interactions on a superconducting circuit testbed with quantum control

bio: Ravi is a research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Head of Measurement at the Advanced Quantum Testbed. He received his PhD at the University of Chicago, working with Professor David Schuster on quantum information science with multimode superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics. His current research focuses on development of high-performance superconducting circuit quantum processors with novel quantum controls for qubits and qudits.

abstract: Multi-qubit entanglement is a valuable resource for several quantum information science applications, including quantum many-body simulation and quantum error correction. However, traditional approaches to control of quantum devices rely on pairwise interactions, making multi-qubit gates costly to execute. This is particularly a challenge for superconducting devices, where connectivity is fixed and restricted to pairwise coupling in almost all cases. Here, we demonstrate a single-step three-qubit gate, the iToffoli, on a fixed-frequency, fixed-coupling superconducting processor using microwave quantum control. The technique leverages simultaneous, non-commuting pairwise entangling drives to realize the gate with fidelity over 98%. This approach represents a novel approach to efficient multi-qubit interactions in limited connectivity systems.
