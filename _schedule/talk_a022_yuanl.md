title: "Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Processors: Instruction Set Architectures, Abstract Machine Models, and Applications"

bio: Yuan Liu is an Assistant Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Computer Science at North Carolina State University. He is also an affiliated faculty in Physics. He received his B.S. in physics from Tsinghua University in Beijing. He received his M.S. in electrical engineering and a Ph.D. in chemical physics from Brown University. Prior to joining NC State faculty, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His research interests lie at the intersection of quantum information science, theoretical chemistry and physics, and quantum engineering.

abstract: Quantum computing with discrete variable (DV, qubit) hardware is approaching the large scales necessary for computations beyond the reach of classical computers. However, important use cases such as quantum simulations of physical models containing bosonic modes, and quantum error correction are challenging for DV-only systems. Separately, hardware containing native continuous-variable (CV, oscillator) systems has received attention as an alternative approach, yet the universal control of such systems is non-trivial. Hybrid CV-DV hardware offers a great advantage in meeting these challenges, offering a powerful computational paradigm that inherits the strengths of both DV and CV processors. In this talk, I will present basics of hybrid CV-DV quantum computation, a variety of new hybrid CV-DV compilation techniques, algorithms, and applications, including the extension of quantum signal processing concepts to CV-DV systems and strategies to simulate systems of interacting spins, fermions, and bosons. To facilitate the development of hybrid CV-DV processor systems, a formal notion of Abstract Machine Models and Instruction
