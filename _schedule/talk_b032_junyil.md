title: "RISC-Q: a generator for real-time quantum control system-on-chip (SoCs) compatible with RISC-V"

abstract: Advancements in quantum hardware and applications drive the rapid development of quantum hardware controllers. While fundamental principles are shared across the control of various quantum systems, the diversity of experiments proposes distinct requirements for each controller. Open-source software has successfully addressed these varying needs by developing modular and composable components within an extensible ecosystem, akin to Linux, maintained through extensive collaboration. Recently, this methodology has been adapted for hardware development, leading to the establishment of an open-source ecosystem centered around RISC-V, an extensible Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). To leverage this emerging open-source hardware ecosystem, we developed RISCQ, an open-source generator for quantum controllers based on the RISC-V ISA. By adopting a software-oriented approach to hardware design, our generator allows for easy extensibility through adding new plugins, without requiring modifications to other parts of the generator. Users can construct a quantum controller simply by composing plugins provided by us or other users, tailored to their specific requirements, without the need for wiring or reimplementing hardware modules. Additionally, our generator includes tools that enable users to create plugins for specialized needs, such as customized decoding and pulse generation logic, which can be easily integrated by others. By incorporating the RISC-V toolchain, including simulators, compilers, and bus protocols, we are establishing a basic framework for collaborative development in quantum control systems.
